<p>The 1980s was one of the most successful and at the same disastrous for the gaming industry yet. Arcades were booming and the third generation of consoles were becoming more and more popular, as well as the inception of PC gaming. It all inevitably came to a market collapse in 1983 after the video game bubble of the <em>Golden Age</em> burst and multiple arcade production companies went out of business. In this blog post, I would like to talk more about the Famicom/ NES console by Nintendo specifically, as it has somewhat revolutionised the way 8-bit sound was treated in games and had enough charm to bring the culture of so-called <em>chiptunes </em>to the 21st century.</p>
