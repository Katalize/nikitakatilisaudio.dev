My favourite games currently are: Dark Souls 1 & 3, Dishonored 1 & 2 and Resident Evil 4 Remake. I am also a big fan of racing simulators and simcades (Assetto Corsa, Gran Turismo 7, Dirt 2). And obviously, I enjoy electronic music production of bass-heavy music, where I can design all the sounds myself. My latest track has been released on Jah Tek under my pseudonym Katalize.

I am also currently diving deep into audio DSP and actively learning PureData and plugin compilation for Wwwise using Heavy
