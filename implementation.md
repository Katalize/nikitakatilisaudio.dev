<h1><mark style="background-color: lightgrey;">Unity + FMOD Pet Project for Master's Thesis</mark> </h1>

<hr class="dotted-line">

This game was created as a methodological approach for a master's thesis on the topic of **"Causing Suspense, Anxiety and Fear Using Sound Design in Video Games"**, which investigated the effectiveness of different sound design approaches in evoking the aforementioned emotions. The player must go through the same level several times, with the soundscape changes in each playthrough.

I developed the game entirely in Unity. FMOD was used to integrate sound assets and logic. 334 unique sound effects were created in Steinberg Nuendo 12, from which 42 events were assembled in FMOD, including music. 8 C# scripts were written for implementation purposes. More details about the project can be found at the links below.
